# my clementine.js boilerplate
This is my "built from scratch" version of clementine.js boilerplate tutorials including Angular refactoring and passport Node.js authentication.

- The baseline javascript version is tagged as v1.0.

- The Angular refactored version is tagged as v2.0.

You can download each of these as a separate release in releases.

The runnng app can be accessed at the url below which is hosted at Heroku.

Couple of Notes:

- This build depends on Heroku local (cli-toolbelt) mode to load up the .env file with the db url and the node port and run locally.  Assumes you have mongo installed and running locally as well.
- You can replace the node process.env.* references in the server.js file with local vars to get up and running in a local environment without the Heroku cli.
